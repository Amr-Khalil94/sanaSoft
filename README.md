as i see the technical test is about member list mainly, so it's should contain navBar, tables and forms

-navBar: according to the test i made localization with two differnt languages english and spanish, the control of this pattern should be happen from anywhere so that i add it in the navBar the same as logging out for sure 

-tables: i used material UI tables and style, i didn't use bootstrap or much css because already mui cover the two porpuse two

-Form: with form i used formik, actualy it's already covering a lot of needs as sumbition, initiation and validation

-for global state i used redux
